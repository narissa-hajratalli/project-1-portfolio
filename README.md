## Additional Libraries
 - jQuery: jQuery was originally used to create the navigation bar before refactoring. It was also used to create the website heading containing my name, the hamburger menu, and the majority of the projects section. 
 
 - JSON: JSON was used to pull in my projects via API call from Google Sheet.
 
 - Google Sheets: Google Sheets was used as a database to hold all of my projects.

 - Google Analytics: Google Analytics was used to see how many visitors I have on my webpage.
 
 - Google Fonts: Google Fonts was used to add different font families to the webpage to make it more aesthetically pleasing. 
 
 - Font Awesome: Font Awesome was used to add logos for CodePen, LinkedIn, GitHub and WordPress. 

## Code Snippet


#### Successfully appending CodePen icons and making CodePen links open in a new tab using target = "_blank"
```
const app = (data) => {

    const createProjectElement = (project) => {
        ...
        //Added codepen icons (See Section 13 References 1 and 2)
        $dxDiv.append($('<a>').attr('href', project.url).attr('target', '_blank').html('<i class="fab fa-codepen fa-2x"></i>').addClass('project-link'));
        $div.append($dxDiv);
        return $div; 
    }
    data.forEach(project => {
        const $projectDiv = createProjectElement(project);
        $('#projects-container').append($projectDiv);
    })
}
```

#### Creating functionality to turn hamburger menu into an 'x' and function that opens the hambuger menu on mobile.
```
//-------CREATING HAMBURGER MENU FUNCTIONALITY------
//This creates the functionality to show my menu items
//---------Section 2, Reference 3---------
jQuery(function($){
    $( '.hamburger' ).click(function(){
        $('.responsive-menu').toggleClass('expand')
    })
 })

 //This creates the functionality to make the hamburger lines turn into an X
 //---------Section 2, Reference 2-----------
let menuOpen = false;
$('.hamburger').click( () => {
    if (!menuOpen) {
        $('.hamburger').addClass('open');
        menuOpen = true;
        console.log('true')
    } else {
        $('.hamburger').removeClass('open');
        menuOpen = false;
        console.log('false')
    }
})
//---------------------END HAMBURGER------------------
```

## Issues and Resolutions
 
#### Having text wrap around a circular picture
Issue: I was having trouble formatting the text to wrap circularly around the photo. After some research, I was able to make the text wrap by storing my photo in another circular div and using shape-around.
```
/*Section 3, References 1 and 2*/
/*Contains my photo and my bio*/
section {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 50px;
}

/*This is the div containing my circular picture. Shape-outside formats the text to curve around the photo*/
.circle {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
    float: left;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin: 20px;
    shape-outside: circle();
}

/*This is my photo inside of the circle class*/
.me {
    display: block; 
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin-top: 80px;
    box-shadow: 1px 12px 12px 2px rgba(0, 0, 255, .2);
    border: 4px solid white;
}
```

#### Creating the navigation bar purely with jQuery
Issue: Originally, I attempted to make my navigation bar using jQuery. I ran into an issue when I tried to add individual hrefs to each navigation element because I was creating a 'jump to' type of navigation. The issue was that I had to store the forEach function inside of another function. While this partially fixed the problem, I still received an additional error that my list items containing each navigation element were not returning properly. In the essence of time, I decided to hardcode the navigation elements in HTML. 
 ``` 
 //-----MY ATTEMPT 1-----

const targets = ['#startabout', '#startproject', '#startcontact'];
const addTargets = targets.forEach((navtargets) => {
     return element.toString();
})
console.log(addTargets);

const $ul = $('<ul>');
$('nav').append("");

//Function to loop through each element in navBar and add it to the nav 
const navBar = ['About Me', 'Projects', 'Contact Me'];
const addToNavBar = navBar.forEach((element) => {
    //Creating list elements and adding class
    const $li = $('<li>');
    ($li).addClass('nav-element');

    //Adding a class of 'hidden' which will be later used for the hamburger menu
    ($li).addClass('hidden');

    //Removing bullets from unordered list
    ($li).css('list-style-type', 'none');

    //Adding anchor tags and href elements to each list element to be later used for the hamburger menu
    const $a = $('<a>').attr('href', '/');
    ($li).append($a);

    //Adding the names of each nav element 
    ($a).text(element);

    //Appending the divs to the unordered list
    ($ul).append($li); 

    return 'Hello World';
})

console.log(addToNavBar());

let scrollItems = targets.map((element) => {
    let item = ($li).attr("href", element);
    console.log(element);
})

scrollItems();

```
Error 
```
addToNavBar is not a function
```

Partial resolution
```
const addToNavBar = () =>{
      navBar.forEach((element) => {
      ...
```
Error 
```
$li is not defined
```

#### Round photo distorting the webpage's format on mobile 
Issue: The round photo started distorting all other elements on smaller screen sizes. My photo and the circular container that it was in was too large for the body so it was shifted to the right side of the screen, spilling outside of the body, while all other elements shifted to the left of the screen. I decided to change the display to none for the image and circular container on smaller screens and added just my image with no direct parent using HTML. I then added properties so the image became more flexible on smaller screens. 

Resolution:
```
HTML
   <!--Circle div for larger screens-->
        <div class='circle'>
            <img class='me' src='https://res.cloudinary.com/ds7vqqwb8/image/upload/v1594739794/Project%201%20-%20Portfolio/IMG_1685_copy_z5smwt.jpg' alt='me'>
        </div>
        
    <!--Placeholder div for my picture on smaller screens-->
        <a name="startaboutphoto" class="target1"><img id='me-small' src='https://res.cloudinary.com/ds7vqqwb8/image/upload/v1594739794/Project%201%20-%20Portfolio/IMG_1685_copy_z5smwt.jpg' alt='me'></a>

```
```
CSS
/*This is the div containing my circular picture. Shape-outside formats the text to curve around the photo*/
.circle {
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
    float: left;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin: 20px;
    shape-outside: circle();
}

/*This is my photo inside of the circle class*/
.me {
    display: block; 
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin-top: 80px;
    box-shadow: 1px 12px 12px 2px rgba(0, 0, 255, .2);
    border: 4px solid white;
}

/*This displays my picture only on screens below 800px.*/
#me-small {
    display: none;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    /*Hides the circle display so that my bio can be formatted under th picture*/
    
    .circle {
        display: none;
    } 
    
    #me-small {
        display: block;
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
        border-radius: 50%;
        box-shadow: 1px 12px 12px 2px rgba(0, 0, 255, .2);
        border: 4px solid white;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
}
```
